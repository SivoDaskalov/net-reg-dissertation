Epigenetics \cite{holliday2006epigenetics} studies the heritable traits that cannot be explained by changes in the DNA sequence. Examples of epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation and histone modification. These mechanisms adjust the expression level of genes \cite{jaenisch2003epigenetic}, which allows organisms to dynamically adapt to changes in the environment.

This is the introduction where you should introduce your work.  In
general the thing to aim for here is to describe a little bit of the
context for your work --- why did you do it (motivation), what was the
hoped-for outcome (aims) --- as well as trying to give a brief
overview of what you actually did.

It's often useful to bring forward some ``highlights'' into 
this chapter (e.g.\ some particularly compelling results, or 
a particularly interesting finding). 

It's also traditional to give an outline of the rest of the
document, although without care this can appear formulaic 
and tedious. Your call.
