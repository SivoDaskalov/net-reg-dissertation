\chapter{Synthetic Dataset Generation}
Synthetic datasets have been generated for use in the hyperparameter tuning process for the various regression methods. These synthetic datasets have been designed to be very similar to real epigenetic datasets. The assumption is that the various regression methods would continue performing well in the context of real epigenetic data after having been tuned on similar generated datasets.

The benefit of using synthetic data for parameter tuning is the existence of ground truth about the relationship between predictors and the target variable. This ground truth enables comparing the various regression methods not only in terms of prediction error, but also with regard to the sensitivity, specificity and precision of their variable selection.
