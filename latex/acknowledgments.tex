{\Huge \bf Acknowledgments}
\vspace{24pt} 

I would like to express my enormous gratitude to Dr Pietro Lio', the best project supervisor I could have dreamed for. Without his selfless devotion, guidance and inspiration not only would this project be impossible, but I would not even be aware of what epigenetics is. 

I would also like to thank Hui Xiao and Antonella Iuliano for our fruitful discussions and helpful advice on areas of biology and statistics previously unfamiliar to me. 

I wish to thank my outstanding lecturers for skillfully establishing the theoretical foundations for my current work, especially in the cold early winter mornings. 

Lastly, I am grateful to all of my newly acquired friends in the Artificial Intelligence group and the MPhil course for creating a thriving atmosphere marked with equal parts of friendliness, productivity and inspiration.
